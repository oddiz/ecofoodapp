## OMEGA idea

### Easier Calculate
    - Remove calc scale
    - Even maybe menu size?
    - Adjust algorithm type based on browser performance?

### Shops
    - users can create shops and define products + prices in them
    - calculate best labor menu (best cal per dollar ), best student menu (best sp dollar) (client side)
    - Pin menus for others to see

### Users
    - favorite menus, 
    - favorite shops
     

### UI
    - animated SP-time graph while calculating
    - sp distrubution bar graph (all iters)
